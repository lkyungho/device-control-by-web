# Web Based Temperature Control System

This project is a remote temperature control system. Users can control temperature from anywhere without being present at an actual place. A temperature sensor can detect the current temperature and send data to the Raspberry Pi to notify the temperature information. Then, the Raspberry Pi transfers data via the Internet so that users can figure out temperature of their desired places and determine which devices they will use.
